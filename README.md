This contest is taken from the real task of Text Processing.

The task is to build a model that will determine the tone (neutral, positive, negative) of the text. To do this, you will need to train the model on the existing data (train.csv). The resulting model will have to determine the class (neutral, positive, negative) of new texts (test data that were not used to build the model) with maximum accuracy.
